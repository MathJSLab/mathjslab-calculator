* `B = reshape (A, M, N, ...)`
* `B = reshape (A, [M N ...])`
* `B = reshape (A, ..., [], ...)`
* `B = reshape (A, SIZE)`

Return a matrix with the specified dimensions `(M, N, ...)` whose
elements are taken from the matrix `A`.

The elements of the matrix are accessed in column-major order (like
Fortran arrays are stored).

The following code demonstrates reshaping a 1x4 row vector into a
2x2 square matrix.

>> `reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)`

>> %%[1, 3; 2, 4]%%

Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix
('prod (size (A))') must match the total number of elements in the
new matrix ('prod ([M N ...])').

A single dimension of the return matrix may be left unspecified and
Octave will determine its size automatically.  An empty matrix ([])
is used to flag the unspecified dimension.

See also: `resize`, `vec`, `postpad`, `cat`, `squeeze`.
