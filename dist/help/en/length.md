* `N = length (A)`

Return the length of the object `A`.

The length is 0 for empty objects, 1 for scalars, and the number of
elements for vectors.  For matrix or N-dimensional objects, the
length is the number of elements along the largest dimension
(equivalent to 'max (size (A))').

See also: `numel`, `size`.
