* `[S1, S2, ..., SN] = ind2sub (DIMS, IND)

Convert linear indices to subscripts.

The input `DIMS` is a dimension vector where each element is the size
of the array in the respective dimension (see `size`).  The second
input `IND` contains linear indices to be converted.

The outputs `S1`, ..., `SN` contain the converted subscripts.

Background: Array elements can be specified either by a linear
index which starts at 1 and runs through the number of elements in
the array, or they may be specified with subscripts for the row,
column, page, etc.  The functions `ind2sub` and `sub2ind`
interconvert between the two forms.

The linear index traverses dimension 1 (rows), then dimension 2
(columns), then dimension 3 (pages), etc. until it has numbered all
of the elements.  Consider the following 3-by-3 matrices:

>> %%[1,4,7;2,5,8;3,6,9]%%

>> %%['1,1', '1,2', '1,3'; '2,1', '2,2', '2,3'; '3,1', '3,2', '3,3']%%

The first matrix contains the linear indices for each matrix
element.  The second matrix shows the subscript tuples for the same
matrix.

The following example shows how to convert the linear indices '2'
and '8' to appropriate subscripts of a 3-by-3 matrix.

>> `ind = [2, 8]`

>> `[r, c] = ind2sub ([3, 3], ind)`

>> %%r =  [2, 2]%%

>> %%c =  [1, 3]%%

If the number of output subscripts exceeds the number of
dimensions, the exceeded dimensions are set to '1'.  On the other
hand, if fewer subscripts than dimensions are provided, the
exceeding dimensions are merged into the final requested dimension.
For clarity, consider the following examples:

>> `ind  = [2, 8]`

>> `dims = [3, 3]`

>> `# same as dims = [3, 3, 1]`

>> `[r, c, s] = ind2sub (dims, ind)`

>> %%r =  [2, 2]%%

>> %%c =  [1, 3]%%

>> %%s =  [1, 1]%%

>> `# same as dims = [9]`

>> `r = ind2sub (dims, ind)`

>> %%r =  [2, 8]%%
