* `Y = logspace (A, B)`
* `Y = logspace (A, B, N)`
* `Y = logspace (A, pi)`
* `Y = logspace (A, pi, N)`

Return a row vector with `N` elements logarithmically spaced from
%%10^A%% to %%10^B%%.

If the number of elements `N` is unspecified it defaults to 50.

If `B` is equal to %%pi%%, the points are between %%10^A%% and %%pi%%, _not_ %%10^A%%
and %%10^pi%%, which is useful in digital signal processing.

Programming Notes: For compatibility with MATLAB&reg;/Octave, return the
right-hand side of the range (%%10^B%%) when a single value (%%N = 1%%) is
requested.  If `N` is not an integer then `floor (N)` is used to
round the number of elements. If `N` is zero or negative then an
empty 1x0 matrix is returned.
