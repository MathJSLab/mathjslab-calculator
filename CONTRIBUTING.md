I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to
help this project come to fruition.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in
[CHANGES.md](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo/blob/main/CHANGES.md) file.

Please consider contributing to the [MathJSLab](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab)
project, which is the core of the [MathJSLab Demo](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo).
See the [Work fronts](#work-fronts) section in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
file for each project to see which project your contribution fits into.

This project has an ISBN assigned to it. Whenever significant changes are made

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[MathJSLab Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to [sergiolindau@gmail.com](mailto:sergiolindau@gmail.com).

## How to Contribute

Check for similar previous [issues](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo/issues) before send your own.

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to MathJSLab Demo](https://github.com/MathJSLab/mathjslab-demo/pull/new/main)
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about
[pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our
coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one
feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Code Conventions

All code is linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. In summary, we adopted:

* We indent using four spaces for code files and two spaces for json files, set by EditorConfig.
* We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`.
* Inline exports with expressions whenever possible:
```typescript
// Use this:
export default class ClassName {

}

// Instead of:
class ClassName {

}
export default ClassName
```
* This is an [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

## Work fronts

The MathJSLab Demo project started almost a decade ago, but it is still in its infancy. There are several work fronts, some already open, others yet to begin, none yet completed.

Some are listed below:

* Implements the choice for only prompt or only batch in Shell object.
* Create a responsive interface to mobile devices.
* Insert Mermaid objects in markdown files through markdown function.

You are welcome to contribute to this project. I will be very grateful if you participate in some way.

Thanks,
Sergio Lindau
