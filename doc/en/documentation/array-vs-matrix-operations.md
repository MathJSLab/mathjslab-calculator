# Array vs. Matrix Operations

## Introduction

MathJSLab has two different types of arithmetic operations: array operations and matrix operations. You can use these arithmetic operations to perform numeric computations, for example, adding two numbers, raising the elements of an array to a given power, or multiplying two matrices.

Matrix operations follow the rules of linear algebra. By contrast, array operations execute element by element operations and support multidimensional arrays. The period character (.) distinguishes the array operations from the matrix operations. However, since the matrix and array operations are the same for addition and subtraction, the character pairs .+ and .- are unnecessary.

## Array Operations

Array operations execute element by element operations on corresponding elements of vectors, matrices, and multidimensional arrays. If the operands have the same size, then each element in the first operand gets matched up with the element in the same location in the second operand. If the operands have compatible sizes, then each input is implicitly expanded as needed to match the size of the other. For more information, see Compatible Array Sizes for Basic Operations.

As a simple example, you can add two vectors with the same size.
