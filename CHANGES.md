# Release notes

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 1.9.4

- Dependencies Updated (`mathjslab` 2.5.4).

## 1.9.3

- Improved dark-mode contrast for gray controls and the shared appearance and
  language icons when they are displayed on green panels.
- Decoupled language menu label colors from calculator-specific control tokens,
  giving App and Calc consistent text colors while exposing component-level
  override variables.
- Reused a dedicated `openMathJSLabFile` helper for toolbar and no-argument
  `open()` actions, and deferred command-output setup until the URL-opening
  branch needs it.
- Updated Sass to 1.104.1.

## 1.9.2

- Added three command workspace modes: batch editor with interactive prompts,
  prompts only, and batch editor with consolidated batch output.
- Integrated the reusable `batch-output` component with optional command echo,
  vertically expanding results, horizontal overflow handling, and responsive
  Plotly containers.
- Introduced presentation-neutral command output targets so MathML, Markdown,
  plots, diagnostics, and other rich output can be rendered in prompts or the
  batch output panel.
- Improved batch execution status so parsing failures and individual command
  failures produce an aggregate completed-with-errors state while subsequent
  commands continue to run.
- Simplified application startup around statically imported Web Components and
  aligned the strict TypeScript configuration with the other web applications.
- Adopted the shared Eleventy and ESLint entry points, PWA manifest, endpoint,
  JSON-LD, robots, sitemap, SCSS declaration, and `tsconfig.webapp.json`
  resources provided by the organization repository.
- Removed persisted language and appearance settings so startup follows browser
  preferences, and replaced the responsive language text control with the
  shared icon-only language and appearance controls using green and white SVG
  variants.
- Moved `PlotEngine`, its output registry, and the `summation` and `productory`
  implementations to shared organization sources while retaining the App-only
  file, Markdown, load, and help integrations.
- Updated dependencies, including `mathjslab` 2.5.3, Plotly 4.1.0, Mermaid 12,
  and the current build and lint tooling.

## 1.9.1

- Dependencies Updated (`mathjslab` 2.5.2).

## 1.9.0

- The app localization structure now follows the same project pattern used by
  `mathjslab-calc` and `mathjslab-batch`, with per-locale i18n data files in
  `data/`, shared Nunjucks page templates, and generated localized endpoints.
- Webpack now emits root, English, Spanish, and Portuguese HTML entry pages
  from Eleventy-generated templates, and the runtime i18n service shares the
  same locale catalog with Eleventy while keeping help, examples, README files,
  and interpreter aliases resolved for the active locale.
- The former app-specific command shell, prompt set, and `batch-panel`
  implementation files have been removed after the shell was rebuilt around
  reusable Web Components.
- Prompt input now uses the shared `command-prompt` Web Component with syntax
  highlighting, responsive MathML output sizing, horizontal overflow handling
  for wide MathML, preserved prompt result states, and the original evaluation,
  history, keyboard navigation, insertion, deletion, and refresh behavior.
- Prompt history now uses the shared `command-prompt-list` Web Component,
  providing the same prompt list behavior used by the calculator project.
- The shared `batch-code-editor` is now used in the application workspace, with
  aligned line numbering, focus styling, syntax highlighting, and a reusable
  control bar containing Run, Clear output, Restore example, and localized
  execution status actions.
- The reusable `control-bar`, `language-switcher`, `appearance-mode`, and
  `application-wrapper` Web Components have been integrated into the app shell
  and registered for reuse from the organization repository.
- The app now uses shared button and panel SCSS templates for a unified visual
  identity across green and gray buttons, command prompts, fixed panels,
  collapsible panels, batch editors, shadows, borders, spacing, and responsive
  prompt gaps.
- `collapsible-content-panel` and `fixed-scroll-panel` styles now follow the
  same shared surface, border, spacing, radius, and dark-mode conventions as
  the generalized Web Components, and are available from the organization
  repository.
- The responsive language switcher and appearance mode button now use shared
  SVG assets, and the appearance mode integration keeps application logos and
  favicons synchronized with light and dark themes.
- The top-right page controls now use a vertical green `control-bar`, while the
  workspace batch controls use a horizontal `control-bar` without a green
  panel.
- The app now includes technical SEO support for `app.mathjslab.com`, including
  localized canonical and Open Graph URLs, JSON-LD page/application metadata,
  localized `hreflang` alternates, a generated `robots.txt`, and a generated
  multilingual sitemap with file-based `lastmod` values.
- Generated assets now include the localized endpoints, SEO metadata, shared
  Web Component templates, and the updated root, English, Spanish, and
  Portuguese app pages.

## 1.8.6

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.5.1).

## 1.8.5

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.5.0).

## 1.8.4

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.4.0).

## 1.8.3

- The application localization layer has been standardized around an
  `intl-messageformat`-based i18n singleton while preserving the existing
  `appEngine.setLanguage()` and component `setLanguage()` APIs.
- Static page text, language selection, localized README loading, theme labels,
  help messages, example captions, and example tooltips now read from the
  shared i18n state.
- Language changes now update interpreter aliases in the existing interpreter
  context without re-evaluating prompts, recreating the workspace, reloading
  the selected example, or replacing user-edited textarea content.
- Source comments and JSDoc have been reviewed for app-owned files touched by
  the localization release.

## 1.8.2

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.3.0).

## 1.8.1

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.2.1).
- English help files have been added for `char`, `deal`, `double`, `isfinite`,
  `isfloat`, `isinf`, `isinteger`, `isnan`, `subsasgn`, `subsref`, and
  `substruct`.
- Spanish and Portuguese translations have been added for the new help files,
  and the localized help indexes now link to them.

## 1.8.0

- The external `plot`, `plot3`, and `surf` functions now translate
  MATLAB/Octave-style numeric arguments, line formats, and basic property pairs
  into Plotly traces instead of rendering placeholder charts.
- Localized examples now demonstrate `plot`, `plot3`, and `surf` with the point
  series, 3D spiral, and sinusoidal surface that previously existed as
  hard-coded placeholder charts.
- The plotting examples have been reordered so point plots, histograms,
  function plots, sampled sine waves, and 3D plots appear together.
- The `help` command now reports a missing topic when a help file cannot be
  found instead of rendering the application's HTML fallback as help content.
- Prompt navigation no longer advances `promptIndex` before the current prompt
  finishes evaluating, keeping asynchronous command output attached to the
  prompt that produced it.
- Changing the application language now updates example button captions and
  tooltips without reloading the current example, preserving user edits in the
  textarea and prompts.
- The asset build now copies root `help/*.md` navigation files alongside the
  localized help directories.

## 1.7.11

- The examples catalog now includes localized programming-oriented examples for
  function definitions, multiple return values, anonymous functions,
  `if`/`elseif` branching, `for` loops, `while` loops, command selection,
  `try`/`catch` error handling, structures, and `classdef` class definitions.
- A localized `switch`/`case` example has been added to demonstrate command
  selection with MATLAB/Octave-style control flow.
- A localized object-oriented programming example has been added to demonstrate
  class inheritance with `vehicle`, `car`, and `truck` classes.
- Source comments and JSDoc have been reviewed, translated to English where
  needed, and expanded for shared application and Web Component helpers.
- The `help/` directory now includes localized GitHub navigation indexes that
  link to all English, Spanish, and Portuguese help files.

## 1.7.10

- The `help/**/addlistener.md`, `help/**/assignin.md`, `help/**/builtin.md`,
  `help/**/cat.md`, `help/**/class.md`, `help/**/cond.md`,
  `help/**/dbstack.md`, `help/**/enumeration.md`, `help/**/error.md`,
  `help/**/eval.md`, `help/**/evalin.md`, `help/**/events.md`,
  `help/**/exist.md`, `help/**/feval.md`, `help/**/fieldnames.md`,
  `help/**/find.md`, `help/**/func2str.md`, `help/**/functions.md`,
  `help/**/inputname.md`, `help/**/isa.md`, `help/**/ischar.md`,
  `help/**/isclass.md`, `help/**/isequal.md`, `help/**/isfield.md`,
  `help/**/islogical.md`, `help/**/ismethod.md`, `help/**/isnumeric.md`,
  `help/**/isobject.md`, `help/**/isprop.md`, `help/**/isreal.md`,
  `help/**/isvalid.md`, `help/**/lasterror.md`, `help/**/lastwarn.md`,
  `help/**/localfunctions.md`, `help/**/metaclass.md`, `help/**/methods.md`,
  `help/**/mfilename.md`, `help/**/nargin.md`, `help/**/narginchk.md`,
  `help/**/nargout.md`, `help/**/nargoutchk.md`, `help/**/notify.md`,
  `help/**/properties.md`, `help/**/rank.md`, `help/**/repmat.md`,
  `help/**/rethrow.md`, `help/**/run.md`, `help/**/sort.md`,
  `help/**/source.md`, `help/**/str2func.md`, `help/**/superclasses.md`,
  `help/**/warning.md`, and `help/**/which.md` files have been created in
  English, Portuguese, and Spanish, with MATLAB and Octave references.
- The command shell variable list has been updated to render function handle
  parameters with the interpreter unparser instead of reading the parameter
  `id` directly, keeping the application compatible with the latest `mathjslab`
  function handle node types.
- The examples panel now supports optional localized example records. Example
  buttons update their captions and description tooltips when the application
  language changes, and the currently selected localized example is reloaded
  from `example/{en,es,pt}/`.
- The old internal engine test files in `example/*.m` have been removed from
  the application examples. The examples catalog now contains localized
  user-facing Nunjucks templates demonstrating common MathJSLab workflows:
  quadratic equations, compound interest, matrix operations, linear systems,
  descriptive statistics, plotting, random simulation, sampled functions,
  logarithmic scales, matrix sums, reshaping, Euclidean distances, temperature
  conversion, population growth, coordinate grids, inventory summaries,
  histograms, unit circles, polynomial evaluation, data normalization, moving
  averages, projectile motion, vector angles, complex numbers, and numeric
  image grids.
- The asset build now removes stale generated `.m` files from `dist/example`
  when they are no longer present in `example/example.json`.

## 1.7.9

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.1.2).

## 1.7.8

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.1.1).

## 1.7.7

- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 2.0.0).

## 1.7.6

- The `formatErrorForHTML.ts` file with a helper for format error messages in
  HTML has been created.
- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 1.9.2).

## 1.7.5

- Bug fix and build stabilization: resolved multiple compilation errors after
  dependency upgrades by aligning the TypeScript and Webpack configurations.
  Updated `tsconfig.json` to include proper `lib` definitions (`ES2022`, `DOM`,
  `DOM.Iterable`), switched module output to `ESNext` to match the ESM setup,
  and explicitly enabled `node` and `wicg-file-system-access` type definitions.
  Added a global module declaration for SCSS files to support side-effect
  imports, and ensured compatibility with modern Webpack behavior. These
  changes restored a successful build process and improved consistency between
  runtime environments and type checking.

## 1.7.4

- The script `"code:stats"`, which displays detailed statistics in terms of the
  number of lines of code in the project, and `"code:stats:summary"`, which
  stores this information in the `report/code.stats.json` file and executes
  `script/helper/code-stats.ts` to display this information, were added to the
  `package.json` file. However, this was reverted in the web application
  project, as it still has flaws (it doesn't ignore selected files), and after
  being adjusted, it will be configured again.
- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 1.9.1).

## 1.7.3

- The `help/**/all.md`, `help/**/any.md`, `help/**/var.md`, `help/**/std.md`
  and `help/**/qr.md` files have been created.
- The `help/**/dot.md` and `help/**/cross.md` files have been updated.
- The contents of the file `example/linear-algebra-help.m` were removed after
  their contents were moved to `example/linear-algebra.m`. It was updated with
  extensive tests for the `det`, `inv`, `qr`, `lu`, `mtimes`, `cross`, and
  `dot` functions.
- The `help/**/configure.md` files have been updated.
- The `example/element-wise.m` file has been created with tests for
  element-wise operations. The contents of the file `example/broadcasting.m`
  have been moved to it.
- The `example/reduce-functions.m` file has been updated with extensive tests
  for functions based on MathJSLab `MultiArray.reduce` function.
- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 1.9.0).

## 1.7.2

- The system of downloading raw files from the repository on GitHub has been
  replaced by cloning the repository and copying selected files.
- Dependecies updated (`mathjslab` 1.8.2).

## 1.7.1

- The `.circleci/config.yml` file was created to adjust the CircleCI tests that
  were failing since the 1.6.0 update.
- The `.editorconfig` file has been changed to include formatting configuration
  for YAML files. Formatting options for YAML files have been added to the
  `prettierrc` file. Changes in `.prettierignore` file.
- The `replace-in-file` package was installed as a development dependency and
  the `replace.fix-endnl.json` file was created to format line breaks with CRLF
  before git add.
- The MathJSLab logo in the .md files has been modified to use logo image in
  the website (mathjslab-www repository).

## 1.7.0

- The `webpack.config.ts` file has been changed to include the
  `devServer.liveReload` and `devServer.server.type` options in the
  `webpack-dev-server` configuration.
- The `.gitignore` and `.prettierignore` files have been changed to ignore the
  `report` directory.
- The following modifications were made due to comply this application to be
  published as a Android Application in the
  [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/) using
  [`capacitor`](https://capacitorjs.com/):
    - The `marked` and `mermaid` packages were installed as regular
      dependencies. The `MathMarkdown` class was renamed to `Markdown` (and its
      `MathMarkdown.ts` file to `Markdown.ts`). The default values for
      including mathematical code to be converted to MathML text are now
      `%...%` (`'inline'`) and `%%...%%` (`'block'`). The MathML encoding was
      implemented in the `renderer.codespan` function of `marked`. Due to
      incompatibilities in the dependencies of the `mermaid` package, the
      `chevrotain` package version 11.0.3 was installed as a development
      dependency and the "overrides" field was configured in the `package.json`
      file so that the `mermaid` dependencies use `chevrotain` version 11.0.3.
    - The `plotly.js-dist-min` package was installed as a regular dependency
      and the `@types/plotly.js-dist-min` package was installed as a
      development dependency. The `PlotEngine.ts` file was modified to use the
      dependencies.
    - The `src/DynamicModule.ts` and `importUMD.ts` files have been deprecated.
      The `DynamicModule.ts` file has been deleted and the `importUMD.ts` file
      has been moved to the `script/helper/` directory of the (MathJSLab
      organization repository)[https://github.com/MathJSLab/.github].

## 1.6.1

- The `rimraf` package has been removed from development dependencies and the
  `shx` package has been added. The scripts in the `package.json` file have
  been changed to use `shx rm -rf` instead of `rimraf`. The `ts-node` package
  has been installed and the `"tsx"` script in the `package.json` file was
  created.
- The `script/helper/prettier-unescape-math.ts` script file was created and
  then moved to the organization repository. The `"postformat"` script in the
  `package.json` was created.

## 1.6.0

- The second release of 2025 (`reia`) has been launch.
- After the changes in MathJSLab version 1.7.3, all references to `window` and
  `global` were changed to `globalThis`.
- Bug fix: Sometimes the `marked` module wouldn't load quickly enough, and the
  application couldn't load and process the `README.md` (or `LEIAME.md`, or
  `LEAME.md`) file at the end of the application body. The `waitFor` function
  was created in the `DynamicModule.ts` file to solve this issue. It was
  included in the `appEngine` object.
- Badges with the number of downloads of `mathjslab` from the npm registry and
  the number of hits on the jsdelivr CDN have been added to `README.md`.
- The `src/includes/miscBibtexEntry.njk` file was created with miscBibtexEntry
  macro. It is used to generate the `mathjslab-[language].bib` files with
  corresponding `mathjslab-[language].bib.njk` Nunjucks templates. The file has
  been moved to the organization repository.
- The `webpack-dev-server` configuration has been improved in the file
  `webpack.config.ts`.
- A global configuration (`"ignores"`) has been added to `eslint.config.cjs`
  configuration file and some definitions of rules and plugins has been grouped
  in a constants.
- Update in help files due to MathJSLab version 1.8 update.
- A setting for formatting `.md` files has been added to the `.prettierrc`
  file.

## 1.5.7

- Target and module changed to ES2022 (`tsconfig.json`).
- All dependencies has been updated, including `mathjslab` (version 1.7.3).

## 1.5.6

- The `lint-staged` package has been removed and the
  `@types/eslint-config-prettier` package has been installed. All dependencies
  have been updated.
- The `.scss` files have been changed to match the latest versions of SASS. The
  occurrences of `map-get` and `map-merge` have been replaced by `map.get` and
  `map.merge`.
- The `src/types/module.scss.d.ts` file has been created and the CSS module
  definition (`*.module.scss`) has been added. The `webpack.config.ts` file has
  been changed to reflect these changes.
- The `data/builddata.json` file has been moved to `eleventy.build.json` and
  references to it in the `eleventy.build.mjs` file have been updated.
- The following scripts in the `package.json`file has been renamed:
    - `"download-resources"` to `"download"`.
    - `"clean:download-resources"` to `"clean:download"`.

## 1.5.5

- The `"type": "module"` field has been added to the `package.json` file and
  the command line option to ignore deprecation warnings when running Eleventy
  (`eleventy.build.mjs`) has been removed.
- All exports have been changed to be named exports and the default exports in
  each module have been enclosed in curly braces.
- The `src/fetchPolyfill.ts` file has been removed. There is no longer any
  polyfill/fallback for the `globalThis.fetch` function.
- The `src/showOpenFilePickerPolyfill.ts` file has been improved: it now uses
  safe fallback when accessing `options.types` and `accept`, adds
  `queryPermission` and `requestPermission` methods to mimic the real API,
  returns an array with all selected files if `options.multiple` is set, and
  uses `Object.entries(type.accept ?? {})` to ensure compatibility.
- All dependencies has been updated, including `mathjslab` (version 1.7.2).

## 1.5.4

- All dependencies has been updated, including `mathjslab` (version 1.7.1).
- The `webpack-bundle-analyzer` plugin has been installed as a development
  dependency. The bundle's build report is saved in the `report/` directory.
  Changes have been made to the `webpack.config.ts` file so that the build is
  configured with the options from the `build.config.json` file. The production
  mode bundle has the option to generate the report with
  `webpack-bundle-analyzer`. The development mode bundle has the option to
  configure the `webpack-dev-server` parameters.
- The CSS style reset (the `src/styles/base/_reset.scss` file) has been
  enhanced to include HTML5 elements and MathML elements. The
  `src/styles/element/_math.scss` file has been created to configure MathML
  elements. Because of the addition of new elements in the CSS style reset,
  more style definitions have been added to the
  `src/styles/abstract/_commons.scss` file to configure elements in general
  after reset and to define semantic variables.
- All comments in the `.scss` files has been made using slashes (///).
- The `src/styles/base/_colors.scss`, `src/styles/base/_sizes.scss`,
  `src/styles/abstract/_define-map.scss` and
  `src/styles/abstract/_constants.scss` files have been copied to the
  organization repository and included in the files listed in
  `download.config.json`.
- The `src/styles/constants.json.njk` template was created, which composes a
  JSON file, at build time, with the definitions of CSS variables that are
  immutable. This file was also copied to the organization's repository.
- The file `src/DeviceScreen.ts` was created, which defines an abstract class
  with only static methods and properties (it should not be instantiated). This
  class provides information about the device screen, updated whenever the
  screen is resized. Its use in the project has not yet been implemented.
- Global definitions have been changed to exports. The `appEngine.ts` file has
  been created to concentrate and export the main application definitions that
  were previously global declarations, so that they are accessible throughout
  the project. The definitions in this file are also exported in the
  `globalThis` object. The removal of global declarations was done to improve
  compatibility with ES Modules.
- The files `externalCmdWListTable.ts`, `externalFunctionTable.ts` and
  `outputFunction.ts` were created and the respective definitions that were in
  the `EvaluatorConfiguration.ts` file were moved to them. The functions
  related to graphs were moved to the `PlotEngine.ts` file, and are referenced
  in the other files. The plot functions still need to be implemented.
- The SVG files format setup in the `.prettierrc` has been set to use the HTML
  parser.

## 1.5.3

- All dependencies has been updated.
- OpenAIRE badges included in documentation.
- The application was completely restructured using Web components. Five Web
  components were created to generate the dynamic structure, previously created
  in the `Shell.initialize` method. The use of the `CreateHTMLElement` function
  was removed from the entire project, with its respective file. Web components
  are defined in a standardized way using method factories and generalized
  types and interfaces. Each Web component class has core definitions of
  properties and methods, static or not, based on factory functions and
  generalized types and interfaces.
- The `src/styles` directory was populated with `.scss` template definitions in
  a structure designed to serve the style definitions in a rationalized and
  standardized way throughout the project. The `src/styles/main.scss` file
  includes all these files and gives a description of the structure of the
  styles directory, with its files. The Web component's own style files are in
  each Web component's directory in `src/components/`. These Web components
  style files use and import the files in the `src/styles` directory. Style
  definitions common to more than one Web component are in
  `src/styles/component`. All colors and sizes are defined rationally in the
  `src/styles/base/_colors.scss` and `src/styles/base/_sizes.scss` files
  respectively. The definitions in the `src/base.css` and `src/main.css` files
  have been moved to the `.scss` files and these files have been removed. The
  `src/mais.scss` file has been created to be the entry point for Webpack
  configuration.
- A button to toogle light/dark mode colors has been created in the
  application's interface.
- Modifications were made to the `README.md`, `LEIAME.md` and `LEAME.md` files
  to announce the structure of the Web application in terms of Web components
  and SCSS templates. Because the Web component templates are inserted at the
  end of the `body` element during the Webpack build, it became unfeasible to
  use the application bundle through the CDN. So the old instructions for
  loading the bundle this way in these files were also removed. For the same
  reason the `src/save-bundle.cjs` file and related scripts in the
  `package.json` has been removed.

## 1.5.2

- The `collapsible-content-panel` **Web Component** has been created an used in
  the examples and readme panels. Some other components has been created in the
  `src/components/` directory but they are not yet full implemented and in use.
- All dependencies has been updated.
- Trademark notices in documentation and after abstract has been introduced.
- The `build.env` file has been removed and the packages `dotenv`,
  `dotenv-expand`, `dotenv-webpack`, `ejs` and `@types/ejs` has been removed
  too.
- The `build.config.json` file was created, which is imported by
  `webpack.config.json` to customize some Webpack build configurations.
- A script (`component.include.ts`) was created that processes the
  `component.include.json` file and generates the `components.ts` file used to
  import the project's components. The script also loads the content of the
  templates to be injected into the HTML.
- The use of `global.ShellPointer` inside the `Shell` class has been removed.
  The `ShellPointer` declaration has been moved to the `main.ts` file and the
  instantiation of `Shell` in the `bootstrap` function has been assigned to
  `global.ShellPointer`. The `bootstrap` function has been made asynchronous
  for this reason. The `export input` in the `main.ts` has been removed. The
  `global.ShellPointer` variable has been kept as it is required in the
  `EvaluatorConfiguration.ts` file.
- The `cross-env` package has been instaled as development dependency and the
  scripts in the `package.json` file has been made platform-independent.
- The `src/types/scss.d.ts` file has been renamed to
  `src/types/styles.scss.d.ts`. The definitions are specialized for importing
  styles from Web components in the form of a string.
- The `cleanNameList` method has been removed from `Shell` class. It's reduced
  to a single instruction: `this.nameList.replaceChildren()`. The
  `replaceChildren` with no arguments do the same: removes all child nodes.
- The `CreateHTMLElement` function has been converted to an arrow function,
  making its code more concise. The arguments were renamed to be more
  significant.
- The `fetchPolyfill` function has been changed to test if the native
  `Response` class is available using it if it is. Otherwise it creates an
  object imitating the methods of the `Response` class.
- Bug fixes and improvements to the `src/styles/abstract/_commons.scss` file.

## 1.5.1

- The MathJSLab logo has been modified. It is built on the MathJSLab
  organization repository, and the 'mathjslab-app' application downloads the
  logo-related files (and other common files too) from the organization
  repository using the `download-files.cjs` script, which also provides a means
  to clean up the downloaded files. The download of these files is triggered by
  the script in the `package.json` file called "download-resources".
- Some changes to the `package.json` file scripts, including scripts to install
  and remove dependencies related to the android apk build.
- Various packages are installed as project development dependencies, among
  them the packages necessary to build Nunjucks templates such as Eleventy, EJS
  and SASS templates. The `data` directory was created to support the building
  of Nunjucks templates using Eleventy (with `script/helper/EleventyUtil.mjs`).
- The `src/build-configuration.json` and `sitemap.xml` files is now generated
  by Nunjucks templates. Previous scripts used to generate this files has been
  removed.
- The `src/component/` directory has been created to contain reused components
  using the **Web Components** suite. The `src/style/` directory has been
  created to contain CSS stylesheets, SASS templates and other related files.
  It has been populated with a subdirectory structure and some `.scss` template
  files.
- The `src/types/` directory has been created with `src/types/scss.d.ts` file
  to tells TypeScript that any file with the `.scss` extension can be imported
  as a module that exports a string. The `tsconfig.json` file has been modified
  to include `paths` and `typeRoots` fields pointing to this type definitions
  directory.
- The `script/tsconfig.json` file has been created with TypeScript
  configurations for the build scripts in the `script` directory. The
  `eslint.config.cjs` file has been enhanced to reflect these updates.
