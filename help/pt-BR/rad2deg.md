* `DEG = rad2deg (RAD)`

Convert radians to degrees.

The input `RAD` must be a scalar, vector, or N-dimensional array of
double or single floating point values. `RAD` may be complex in
which case the real and imaginary components are converted
separately.

The output `DEG` is the same size and shape as `RAD` with radians
converted to degrees using the conversion constant `180/pi`.

Example:

>> `rad2deg ([0, pi/2, pi, 3/2*pi, 2*pi])`

>> %%[0, 90, 180, 270, 360]%%

See also: `deg2rad`.
